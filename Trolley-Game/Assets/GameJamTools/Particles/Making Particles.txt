Steps to making particles --

1) Make a particles system in the scene
2) Attach a "ParticleBehaviour" to it. This will recall it to its object pool.
3) Prefab it
4) Make a new ParticleObject by going to the Project view, and hitting Right Click->GameJamTools->Particle Object
5) Drag the prefab into the slot

Spawning Particles --

1) Make a script with a public or [SerializeField] ParticleObject reference
2) When you want to spawn it, call its .Spawn(position) function. It will make the call to ParticleManager.Instance() and you should see a GameJamTools.ParticleManager appear under the DontDestroyOnLoad tab of the hierarchy


Notes:
- Non looping particles are recycled automatically
- looping particles have to be manually told to recycle.
